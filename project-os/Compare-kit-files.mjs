// Compare-kit-files.mjs - compares this project's copy of the kit with a fresh
// clone of the kit, file by file, and on the owner's word copies only the files
// that are safe to copy and writes only the merges that came out clean. It
// never deletes anything outside its own review folder, .tmp/kit-merge/, and
// never touches a living record.
//
// Why: the kit keeps fixing its guards, its scripts and its install law, and an
// installed project keeps the copy it was installed with. Copying a newer kit
// over the old one replaces History and Decisions with empty templates and
// undoes every calibration the install made, so until now an installed project
// was simply never updated. This tells, per file, who changed what since the
// install, from three copies of it:
//   BASE  the file in the kit at the commit this project was installed from
//         (project-os/Kit-version.json, or --base <commit>, or found in the
//         kit's history when neither names one), read with
//         git -C <kit> show <base>:<path>
//   KIT   the file in the fresh clone now
//   HERE  the project's file
// It runs on the owner's `Go update kit` (CLAUDE.md, 2026-10-01), which fetches
// the kit into .tmp/projectos-kit with its full history: a clone made with
// --depth 1 has no BASE to read. A project copied in by hand or from a ZIP
// records no BASE, so its scripts and guards name it instead: the kit's history
// is searched for the commit whose copies of them all match this project's,
// line endings aside (2026-10-02). That search reads every commit the clone
// holds, so it needs the full history too; a --depth 1 clone recognises only
// its newest commit. When nothing matches, the report says to pass the kit
// commit named in the install row of project-os/History.md.
//
//   node project-os/Compare-kit-files.mjs --kit .tmp/projectos-kit                 report only
//   node project-os/Compare-kit-files.mjs --kit .tmp/projectos-kit --base 1a80938  name the base
//   node project-os/Compare-kit-files.mjs --kit .tmp/projectos-kit --apply         copy the safe ones
//   node project-os/Compare-kit-files.mjs --kit .tmp/projectos-kit --record        record the kit commit
//
// The install runs that last line too, right after it copies the kit in, from
// its own --depth 1 fetch: every file still matches that one commit, so the
// project knows its kit from the first minute (2026-10-02).
//
// Run it from the project root. What each kind of file gets:
//   machinery   current | kit updated (HERE equals BASE, the kit changed it: safe
//               to copy) | changed here only (keep) | changed on both sides
//               (conflict: reported, never overwritten) | new in the kit (in
//               the kit and not here, nor at BASE: safe to copy) | removed
//               here (at BASE and deleted in this project: reported, never
//               copied back) | gone from the kit (reported, never deleted).
//               With no BASE known, a file in the kit and not here is still
//               "new in the kit", since there is nothing of the project's to
//               overwrite; any other file that differs is "cannot tell who
//               changed it" and is never copied.
//   calibrated  adapted at install, so never copied over as it is: the report
//               says how many lines the kit changed between BASE and KIT, and
//               where, and merges those changes into this copy with git
//               merge-file. Both kit copies are first filled with this
//               project's own values (its name, its owner, its address, its
//               check command), read from its files: a filled-in value is not
//               this project's own wording, and merged unfilled it read as a
//               clash at every line the kit touched or wrote next to
//               (2026-10-02). The owner's answer the install writes in place
//               of a bracketed choice, and the marks it writes after a value
//               nothing can run yet, are read the same way. A line counts as
//               filled only when the values give exactly that line; one
//               holding a placeholder filled two ways, or any added wording,
//               stays this project's own. Each merge goes to
//               .tmp/kit-merge/<path> for review, with the filled kit copies
//               under .tmp/kit-merge/.inputs/. The report says per file:
//               already carried, merged cleanly, merged but bringing a
//               placeholder nothing here fills, or each clash with its lines,
//               a setup block or a mark the install wrote told apart from this
//               project's own wording. One that is new in the kit and missing
//               here is reported as "new in the kit: copy it by hand and fill
//               its setup block".
//   record      a living record of this project: never compared, never touched.
//               The kit's own template of it is read, though: the report says
//               how many of its lines changed between BASE and KIT, so an
//               instruction change can be carried over by hand (2026-10-01).
// Without --apply or --record it writes nothing in this project but that
// review folder, which each compare empties and fills again.
// With --apply it copies only "kit updated" and "new in the kit" machinery,
// and writes each calibrated merge that came out clean over this project's
// copy, in that copy's line endings. It then writes project-os/Kit-version.json
// with the clone's short HEAD and today's date, but only when nothing is left
// to carry over by hand: no machinery file "changed on both sides" or "cannot
// tell who changed it", and no calibrated file with a clash, a placeholder to
// fill, a kit change git could not merge, or one new in the kit that this copy
// does not match yet. While one is left it writes no version and names those
// files, to be carried over by hand and then recorded with --record. Recording
// the base sooner would hide the kit's changes to them for good: the next
// compare would read each machinery file as changed here only and each
// calibrated one as unchanged in the kit (2026-10-01). A machinery file
// removed here never holds the version back, since the project chose to be
// without it. A base found in the kit's history is the exception: while files
// are left, --apply writes that base before it copies anything, since the
// copies would hide it from the next search (2026-10-02). When the CLAUDE.md
// it writes carries changed Go update kit steps, its last line says to finish
// the update with those (2026-10-02).
// With --record it writes the same two fields once those files are carried
// over, and first prints every machinery and calibrated file that still
// differs from the kit, so recording a base is a step taken knowingly. With no
// base recorded and this project's scripts and guards matching an older kit
// commit than the clone's HEAD, it records that commit instead: these files
// came from it. It takes no --base, is never combined with --apply, and copies
// nothing.
// Exit 0 on success; 1 on a usage error, a kit folder that is missing, a copy
// or a merge that could not be written, or a version that could not be written.
