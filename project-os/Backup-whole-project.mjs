// Backup-whole-project.mjs - one local, self-contained ZIP snapshot of the whole
// project, the Node twin of Backup-whole-project.ps1.
//
// Why this exists: offline disaster recovery that does NOT depend on any git
// host or sync folder. Code, docs, content and the full git history in one
// file you can put on a drive; regenerable build folders are left out so the
// ZIP stays small and restorable. Node so a machine without PowerShell makes
// the same snapshot; the ZIP is written with Node's own zlib, so nothing has
// to be installed.
//
// TWIN. Backup-whole-project.ps1 does exactly this in PowerShell. The two keep
// the same setup block, the same exclusions, the same ZIP name, the same
// messages (here a detail line puts a colon between a path and its reason)
// and the same failure contract, so a change to one is made to the other in
// the same edit (2026-10-01).
//
// Run it, from the project root:
//   node project-os/Backup-whole-project.mjs
// It makes the same snapshot as the `Go backup` shortcut in CLAUDE.md.
//
// FAILURE CONTRACT. This script has exactly two outcomes:
//   success  -> exit 0, a `<project>_<stamp>.zip` exists in backups/, every
//               file and folder the walk found is listed in that archive by
//               name, and the git history in it opens (THE HISTORY CHECK
//               below). Outside .git, names are checked, not contents: a
//               damaged entry is not caught.
//   failure  -> exit 1, the reason on stderr, and no ZIP from this run left
//               behind (a ZIP of the same name from an EARLIER run can be).
// There is deliberately no third "mostly worked" outcome. A backup that quietly
// skipped a locked file or an unreadable folder is the one kind that hurts you,
// because the gap shows up only when you are already restoring.
// On success it also prints "Left out by name:", every folder the walk skipped
// because of its name. A source folder on that line means the list below needs
// changing.
//
// THE HISTORY CHECK (2026-10-02). Folders go into the ZIP as entries of their
// own, so a folder that holds no file comes back on a restore. Git packs its
// refs into one file now and then, at the end of a commit or a pull, and
// leaves .git/refs holding only empty folders; a ZIP of files alone then
// restored a .git without refs, which git refuses to call a repository, while
// the run had said OK. So whenever the ZIP holds the project's .git, the run
// proves that history opens before it calls the ZIP good: .git/HEAD,
// .git/objects and .git/refs must be in the archive, and where git is on this
// machine, every entry under .git is copied out of the finished archive into a
// folder of its own in backups/, git opens that copy and reads its latest
// commit, and the folder is removed again. Without git, the three parts alone
// are checked, and the run says so.
//
// WHAT IS NEVER IN THE ZIP, whatever the list below says: the backups/ and .tmp/
// (scratch) folders at the project root, the assistant's personal settings
// (.claude/settings.local.json and its .backup copy, which can hold keys and
// this machine's paths), its worktree copies (.claude/worktrees, whole copies
// of the repository), the .codex folder at any depth, atomic-write leftovers
// (*.tmp, *.tmp.*), and the env files (.env*, .dev.vars*; a template such as
// .env.example, .env.sample or .dev.vars.template is kept), so a restore
// recreates them by hand from the templates. The rest of .claude travels: the
// committed settings.json, which can carry the team's guard wiring, and the
// project's own commands, agents and skills. Common key files stay out too, by
// name (KEY_FILE_PATTERNS below). A secret saved under any other name travels
// in the ZIP, so keep those outside the project. The env and key file rules
// skip the project's own .git, so a branch called fix/credentials travels with
// the history (2026-10-02). Names compare without regard to case, as
// PowerShell's -contains and -like do in the twin.
//
// A git worktree or submodule is refused: its .git is a file pointing at
// history kept in another folder, so the ZIP would hold no history. Commit
// there, then run this from the main project folder.
//
// ONE DIFFERENCE THE PLATFORM FORCES. On Windows the twin opens each file so
// that no other program may write to it meanwhile, and fails on a file another
// program holds open for writing. Node cannot ask for that, so this twin reads
// each file's size and modification time before and after copying it, and
// fails the same loud way when either moved.
//
// THE ZIP WRITER uses Node built-ins only. Each file is deflated through zlib
// and its CRC-32 comes from the table below; a large file is streamed, never
// held whole in memory: the local header goes first, the deflated bytes follow,
// and the CRC and sizes are patched into the header in place. ZIP64 records
// are written whenever a size, an offset or the entry count passes its 32-bit
// or 16-bit field. Names are UTF-8 (flag bit 11) with forward slashes, and
// each entry carries its file's modification time. A folder is an entry of
// its own: no data, stored, its name ending in a slash. On macOS and Linux an
// entry also carries the file's permission bits, so a restored script stays
// executable, as it does from the twin under pwsh. PROJECTOS_FORCE_ZIP64=1 writes every
// record in its ZIP64 form, so the kit's tests reach that path with a tiny
// project; it changes nothing about what goes in.
