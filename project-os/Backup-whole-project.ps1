# Backup-whole-project.ps1
# Its Node twin is Backup-whole-project.mjs, and the two must always change together.
# Why this exists: one local, self-contained ZIP snapshot of the whole project,
# for offline disaster recovery that does NOT depend on any git host or sync
# folder. Code, docs, content and the full git history in one file you can put
# on a drive. PowerShell so nothing has to be installed on Windows; regenerable
# build folders are left out so the ZIP stays small and restorable.
#
# Run it, from the project root:
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File project-os/Backup-whole-project.ps1
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File project-os/Backup-whole-project.ps1          (macOS / Linux)
# It is wired to the `Go backup` shortcut in CLAUDE.md.
#
# FAILURE CONTRACT. This script has exactly two outcomes:
#   success  -> exit 0, a `<project>_<stamp>.zip` exists in backups/, every
#               file and folder the walk found is listed in that archive by
#               name, and the git history in it opens (THE HISTORY CHECK
#               below). Outside .git, names are checked, not contents: a
#               damaged entry is not caught.
#   failure  -> exit 1, the reason on stderr, and no ZIP from this run left
#               behind (a ZIP of the same name from an EARLIER run can be).
# There is deliberately no third "mostly worked" outcome. A backup that quietly
# skipped a locked file or an unreadable folder is the one kind that hurts you,
# because the gap shows up only when you are already restoring.
# On success it also prints "Left out by name:", every folder the walk skipped
# because of its name. A source folder on that line means the list below needs
# changing.
#
# THE HISTORY CHECK (2026-10-02). Folders go into the ZIP as entries of their
# own, so a folder that holds no file comes back on a restore. Git packs its
# refs into one file now and then, at the end of a commit or a pull, and
# leaves .git/refs holding only empty folders; a ZIP of files alone then
# restored a .git without refs, which git refuses to call a repository, while
# the run had said OK. So whenever the ZIP holds the project's .git, the run
# proves that history opens before it calls the ZIP good: .git/HEAD,
# .git/objects and .git/refs must be in the archive, and where git is on this
# machine, every entry under .git is copied out of the finished archive into a
# folder of its own in backups/, git opens that copy and reads its latest
# commit, and the folder is removed again. Without git, the three parts alone
# are checked, and the run says so.
#
# WHAT IS NEVER IN THE ZIP, whatever the list below says: the backups/ and .tmp/
# (scratch) folders at the project root, the assistant's personal settings
# (.claude/settings.local.json and its .backup copy, which can hold keys and
# this machine's paths), its worktree copies (.claude/worktrees, whole copies
# of the repository), the .codex folder at any depth, atomic-write leftovers
# (*.tmp, *.tmp.*), and the env files (.env*, .dev.vars*; a template such as
# .env.example, .env.sample or .dev.vars.template is kept), so a restore
# recreates them by hand from the templates. The rest of .claude travels: the
# committed settings.json, which can carry the team's guard wiring, and the
# project's own commands, agents and skills (review 2026-09-28: leaving the
# whole folder out restored a project with no guards, and the next commit
# could record the team's settings file as deleted). Common key files stay out
# too, by name ($KeyFilePatterns below). A secret saved under any other name
# travels in the ZIP, so keep those outside the project. The env and key file
# rules skip the project's own .git, so a branch called fix/credentials
# travels with the history (2026-10-02).
#
# A git worktree or submodule is refused: its .git is a file pointing at
# history kept in another folder, so the ZIP would hold no history. Commit
# there, then run this from the main project folder.
