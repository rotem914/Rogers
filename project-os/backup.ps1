# backup.ps1
# Why this exists: one local, self-contained ZIP snapshot of the whole project,
# for offline disaster recovery that does NOT depend on any git host or sync
# folder. Code, docs, content and the full git history in one file you can put
# on a drive. PowerShell so nothing has to be installed on Windows; regenerable
# build folders are left out so the ZIP stays small and restorable.
#
# Run it, from the project root:
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File project-os/backup.ps1
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File project-os/backup.ps1          (macOS / Linux)
# It is wired to the `Go backup` shortcut in CLAUDE.md.
#
# FAILURE CONTRACT. This script has exactly two outcomes:
#   success  -> exit 0, a `<project>_<stamp>.zip` exists in backups/, and every
#               file the walk found was read back OUT of that archive by name.
#   failure  -> exit 1, the reason on stderr, and NO .zip left behind.
# There is deliberately no third "mostly worked" outcome. A backup that quietly
# skipped a locked file or an unreadable folder is the one kind that hurts you,
# because the gap shows up only when you are already restoring.
#
# WHAT IS NEVER IN THE ZIP, whatever the list below says: the backups/ folder
# itself, the assistant's machine-local folders (.claude, .codex), the scratch
# folder (.tmp), atomic-write leftovers (*.tmp, *.tmp.*), and real secret files
# (.env, .env.*, .dev.vars, .dev.vars.*; the .example templates are kept). A
# snapshot must be safe to carry to external storage, so secrets stay out and a
# restore recreates them by hand from the templates.
