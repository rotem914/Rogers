// Installs this project's hooks, by merging project-os/Hooks-settings.json into

// Installation.md section 6b. The owner can also run it by hand at any time.
//
//   node project-os/Install-project-hooks.mjs
//
// Flags:
//   --dry       show what would change and write nothing
//   --shared    write to .claude/settings.json (committed, shared with the team)
//               instead of .claude/settings.local.json (personal, usually
//               gitignored, so it reaches only this machine)
//   --replace   replace an event's existing hooks instead of running beside them
//               (--force is an older name for it)
// Any other option is refused before anything is read or written, so a
// mistyped --dry never turns into a real write.
//
// The guards under project-os/guards/ ride in the same file, named through
// "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}", the folder Claude Code fills in before the hook
// runs. On Windows a session opened in a subfolder loads only that folder's
// settings, while on macOS and Linux it also loads the git root's
// settings.local.json. Where the guards land decides what the path becomes:
//   - the personal file (the default) keeps "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}" on
//     Windows, so a renamed or moved project keeps its guards; on macOS and
//     Linux it gets this project's own path instead, because a subfolder
//     session reads this file there while CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR names the
//     subfolder, and a guard named through it would not be found (review
//     2026-09-25). The guard itself then walks up from that subfolder to the
//     project root, so it guards the whole project, not the subfolder;
//   - the shared file (--shared) keeps "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}", so the same
//     committed file works on every computer and in a cloud session. Open
//     sessions at the project root there.
// On macOS and Linux a moved or renamed project is covered by the plugin,
// which runs its own copy of a guard whose file is gone; without the plugin,
// run this installer again there. A project whose folder path holds a $, a
// backtick or a double quote (or, on macOS and Linux, a backslash) is refused,
// because each one breaks the quoted path inside the hook command and the
// guards would silently not run.
//
// DEFAULT IS COMBINE, NOT REPLACE. A hook event holds a LIST, so this project's
// hooks are appended to whatever is already there and both run. Nothing the
// project already had is removed, reworded or reordered. `--replace` is the
// deliberate exception, for when the existing hook is known to be broken.
//
// Safe by design: it never rewrites a settings file it could not parse, it
// writes a .backup first, and it is idempotent, since a hook already present
// is recognised and not added twice. A guard is recognised by the script it
// runs, however its path is written: through ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR},
// $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR or %CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR%, with backslashes, or, on
// Windows, in another letter case.
//
// HOW IT FAILS. Before touching anything it proves the target folder is
// writable with one probe file, so a full disk, a read-only folder or a
// permission block fails in a second with one plain sentence and a remedy,
// never halfway through with a stack trace. Nothing is reported as added until
// the settings file has actually been written and renamed into place; before
// that the summary says "will add". A run that prints "added:" wrote the file.
//
// PROVING IT IS WIRED. Running the hook scripts by hand proves they work, not
// that they are installed. `--dry` answers that: every event listed under
// "present:" is wired, and any event under "will add:" is NOT. A plain `--dry`
// also counts what the committed settings.json carries. On Windows that proves
// a --shared install as well. On macOS and Linux it still wants the guards in
// the personal file (see coveredByOther below), so there a --shared install is
// proven only by `--dry --shared`. Under the once-per-computer plugin (README,
// "Once per computer") the hooks run from its folder for any project with
// project-os/, so there "will add:" means this file only; the run says so when
// it sees the plugin folder (install report, 2026-09-29). Only the folder can
// be seen from here; that the assistant loaded it is proven by the live check
// in Installation.md 6b.
//
// A WARNING, NEVER A REFUSAL. A reminder's text sits inside '...' inside "..."
// in a shell command, so an apostrophe, a double quote, a backtick, a $ or a
// backslash in it is read by the shell: the reminder then arrives cut short
// or not at all. The run names the event and carries on; the guards in the
// same file are not affected.
